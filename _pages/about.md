I'm an undergraduate student in National Taiwan University, with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Psychology. 

My learning and research experiences span across many disciplines. Particularly, I learn and practice **engineering**, **computer science**, **psychology**, and **sociology**. Currently, my works focus on Computational Social Science, Algorithmic Fairness, and Network Science. I have been fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. Hung-Yun Hsieh, Prof. Ho-Lin Chen, and Dr. Hsuan-Wei Lee during my undergraduate study.  

Here is my [curriculum vitae](https://leohcliou.github.io/files/CV20200511.pdf)
