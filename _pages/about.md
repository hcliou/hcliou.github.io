I'm an undergraduate student in National Taiwan University, with a major in Electrical Engineering. 

My learning and research experiences span across many disciplines. Broadly Speaking, I am interested in works that bridge between different displines, especially between engineering and social science. Curretnly, my research works focus on **Network and Data Science**. 

I have been fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://ccf.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hyhsieh/" target="_blank">Hung-Yun Hsieh</a>, Prof. <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=100129" target="_blank">Ho-Lin Chen</a>, and Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hsuanweilee/" target="_blank">Hsuan-Wei Lee</a> during my undergraduate study. 

Keywords: *network science*, *data science*, *computational social science*, *algorithmic fairness*. 

Here is my <a href="/files/CV20210612.pdf" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a> (last update: June 2021), and here is a longer, and more tedious, [biography](/longbio/).

## Trivia

In my not-so-leisure time, I would devote my time to the following topics: 

* Physics
* Psychology: especially Critical Psychology and other nonmainstream approaches
* Sociology: theory and some emerging topics, such as emotion and friendship
