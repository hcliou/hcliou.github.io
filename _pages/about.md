I'm an undergraduate student in National Taiwan University, with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Psychology. 

My learning and research experiences span across many disciplines. Particularly, I learn and practice **engineering**, **computer science**, **psychology**, and **sociology**. Broadly Speaking, I am interested in works that bridge between different displines, computer science and social science specifically. I have been fortunate to work under the supervision of <a href="http://ccf.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hyhsieh/" target="_blank">Prof. Hung-Yun Hsieh</a>, <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=100129" target="_blank">Prof. Ho-Lin Chen</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hsuanweilee/" target="_blank">Dr. Hsuan-Wei Lee</a> during my undergraduate study. Some relevant keywords are: *computational social science*, *algorithmic fairness*, *network science*. 

Here is my <a href="/files/CV20201118.pdf" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a>
