I'm a researcher from Taiwan currently a research assistant working with Prof. <a href="http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~ihsiangw/" target="_blank"> I-Hsiang Wang </a>. Recently, I just received my M.S. in **Communication Engineering** and a Certificate in **Women's and Gender Studies**. I received my B.S.E. in **Electrical Engineering** from College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National Taiwan University (NTU). During my undergraduate study in NTU, I was also trained in Psychology and Sociology.  

My learning and research experiences span across many disciplines. Broadly Speaking, I am interested in works that bridge between different displines, especially between engineering and social science. Curretnly, my research works focus on **Algorithmic Fairness**, and I propose to utilize the tools from **information theory** to ensure fairness. 

I have been fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://ccf.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hyhsieh/" target="_blank">Hung-Yun Hsieh</a>, Prof. <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=100129" target="_blank">Ho-Lin Chen</a>, and Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hsuanweilee/" target="_blank">Hsuan-Wei Lee</a> during my undergraduate study. 

Keywords: *algorithmic fairness*, *information theory*, *gender studies*. 

Here is my <a href="/files/CV_2025Feb.pdf" target="_blank"> curriculum vitae </a>. (last update: February, 2025).

## News
* I expect to participate in the <a href="http://infotheory.ca/nasit2024/index.html" target="_blank"> 2024 North American School of Information Theory</a>. Seeing you in Ottawa!

## Trivia

1. In my not-so-leisure time, I would devote my time to the following topics, mostly in the form of reading: 
   * Math and Physics
   * Philosophy: politcal philosophy, epistemology, and philosophy of science
   * Psychology and Psychotherapy: especially critical psychology and other nonmainstream approaches
   * Sociology: theory and some emerging topics, such as emotion and friendship
