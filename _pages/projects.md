***Advisor: Hung-Yun Hsieh***

Network science is the study of networks, which are characterized by interconnected entities and their connections. Network is a natural representation for many kinds of phenomena. For example, the relationship among a group of people can be characterized by a social network, the human brain can be described as a network consisting hundreds of billions of neurons, and so on. Network science has been shown as a powerful approach to understand the complex structure and functions of varios kinds of networks. 

I am particularly interested in how network science can be applied to the study in psychology. I addressed how the friendship network emerges from dyadic friendship formation and maintenance. Specifically, I wanted to study what kind of role **personality** plays in this process.

Motivated by my study in [networks cience](/projects/#network-science), I want to further study how to use computational methods to answer social science questions.
