## Some Background

In the winter of 1997 (the same in year in which [Hong-Kong's sovereignty was trasferred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handover_of_Hong_Kong)), I was born in Taipei, Taiwan. 

My ehinicity, to the best of my knowledge, is mostly [Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese), the most dominant racial group in Taiwan. My paternal grandfather moved to Taiwan from Hunan, China (at that time, still under the regime of Kuomington, or nationalist party), during the [Chinese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War). Born and raised in the era when ethnic and national identity was dramatically transforming, my background urged me to know more about the political and social world, an how it is related to our individual experiences. 

Another reason that I was pushed into the quest of social science, especially sociology, is my experience with gender and sexuality. In my childhood and adolescence, I was experiencing prejudice and bigotry because of my gender expression. In 2013, the same year I started senior high school, some parliament members propose an act to legalize same-sex marriage in Taiwan; that was the time when I started to concern about and involve into political and societal issues. In 2016, the same year I start my university, a similar act for same-sex recognition; that was the time that I started to directly involve in social movement.
